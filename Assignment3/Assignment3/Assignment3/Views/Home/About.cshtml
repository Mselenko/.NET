    This assignment provides a hands-on experience while learning about the fundamentals of cloud computing using the
    Microsoft Azure platform. Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), 
    and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more.
